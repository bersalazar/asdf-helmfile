  # We have a little hack here to try and determine (without any
  # external dependencies) whether we have a version number that is at
  # least 0.145.0, or less than 0.145.0 - because older versions are
  # from the roboll/helmfile repo while newer ones are from the
  # helmfile/helmfile repo. So the way we do this is we print both the
  # requested version and 0.145.0 to stdout, run them through sort
  # (which essentially does a comparison of them), grab the first one
  # (so whichever one sorted first), and compare it to 0.145.0. If the
  # provided version number if 0.145.0 or greater, then the result
  # will be 0.145.0, but otherwise, the result will be the provided
  # version number. So this should in principle check ~reliably for
  # whether we are at least 0.145.0 or not.
